            Jammu and Kashmir, union territory of India <strong>(until October 31, 2019, a state)</strong>, located in
            the northern part of
            the Indian subcontinent centred on the plains around Jammu to the south and the Vale of Kashmir to the
            north.
            The union territory is part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between
            India, Pakistan, and China since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947. Legislation passed in August
            2019
            set the stage for downgrading Jammu and Kashmir from statehood to union territory status and splitting off a
            part of it, known as the Ladakh region, into a separate union territory. The change went into effect on
            October
            31 of that year, though several court cases affecting its status remained pending in the years that
            followed.

        <p>
            Jammu and Kashmir, formerly one of the largest princely states of India, is bounded to the east by the
            Indian
            union
            territory of Ladakh, to the south by the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, to the southwest by
            Pakistan,
            and to the northwest by the Pakistani-administered portion of Kashmir. The administrative capitals are
            Srinagar
            in
            summer and Jammu in winter. Area 16,309 square miles (101,387 square km). Pop. (2011) 12,367,013.

    <h4>Jammu and Kashmir, India: streams and settlements</h4>
    <p>
        The vast majority of the union territory is mountainous, and the physiography is divided into five zones that
        are
        closely associated with the structural components of the western Himalayas. From west to east those zones
        consist of
        the plains, the foothills, the Pir Panjal Range, the Vale of Kashmir, and the Great Himalayas zone. The climate
        varies from alpine on the eastern edge to subtropical in the southwest. In the alpine area average annual
        precipitation is about 3 inches (75 mm), but in the subtropical zone (around Jammu) rainfall amounts to about 45
        inches (1,150 mm) per year. The entire region is prone to violent seismic activity, and light to moderate
        tremors
        are common. A strong earthquake centred in neighbouring Pakistani-administered Kashmir killed hundreds in Jammu
        and
        Kashmir state in 2005.
    </p>

    <h3>The plains</h3>
    <p>
        The narrow zone of plains landscape in the Jammu region is characterized by interlocking sandy alluvial fans
        that
        have been deposited by streams discharging from the foothills and by a much-dissected pediment (eroded bedrock
        surface) covered by loams and loess (wind-deposited silt) of Pleistocene age (about 11,700 to 2,600,000 years
        old).
        Precipitation is low, amounting to about 15 to 20 inches (380 to 500 mm) per year, and it occurs mainly in the
        form
        of heavy but infrequent rain showers during the summer monsoon (June to September). The countryside has been
        almost
        entirely denuded of trees, and thorn scrub and coarse grass are the dominant forms of vegetation.
    </p>

    <h3>The foothills</h3>
    <p>
        The foothills of the Himalayas, rising from about 2,000 to 7,000 feet (600 to 2,100 metres), form outer and
        inner
        zones. The outer zone consists of sandstones, clays, silts, and conglomerates, influenced by Himalayan folding
        movements and eroded to form long ridges and valleys called duns. The inner zone consists of more-massive
        sedimentary rock, including red sandstones of Miocene age (roughly 5.3 to 23 million years old), that has been
        folded, fractured, and eroded to form steep spurs and plateau remnants. River valleys are deeply incised and
        terraced, and faulting has produced a number of alluvium-filled basins, such as those surrounding Udhampur and
        Punch. Precipitation increases with elevation, and the lower scrubland gives way to pine forests higher up.
    </p>

    <h3>The Pir Panjal Range</h3>
    <p>
        The Pir Panjal Range constitutes the first (southernmost) mountain rampart associated with the Himalayas in the
        union territory and is the westernmost of the Lesser Himalayas. It has an average crest line of 12,500 feet
        (3,800
        metres), with individual peaks rising to some 15,000 feet (4,600 metres). Consisting of an ancient rock core of
        granites, gneisses, quartz rocks, and slates, it has been subject to considerable uplift and fracturing and was
        heavily glaciated during the Pleistocene Epoch. The range receives heavy precipitation in the forms of winter
        snowfall and summer rain and has extensive areas of pasture above the tree line. It is drained principally by
        the
        Jhelum, Punch, and Chenab rivers.
